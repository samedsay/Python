# Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.
# The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.
# For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:
# remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3)

def remove_middle(lst, start, end):
  newList = lst[:start] + lst[end+1:]
  return newList

print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))
